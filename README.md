# Food Marketing Analysis

## Project Overview

We consider a well-established company operating in the retail food sector. Presently, they have around several hundred thousands of registered customers and serve almost one million consumers a year. They sell products from 5 major categories: wines, rare meat products, exotic fruits, specially prepared fish and sweet products. These can further be divided into gold and regular products. The customers can order and acquire products through 3 sales channels: physical stores, catalogs and companyâ€™s website. 

Globally, the company had solid revenues and a healthy bottom line in the past 3 years, but the profit growth perspectives for the next 3 years are not promising. For this reason, several strategic initiatives are being considered to invert this situation. One is to improve the performance of marketing activities, with a special focus on marketing campaigns.

The marketing department was pressured to spend its annual budget more wisely. Desirably, the success of these activities will prove the value of the approach and convince the more skeptical within the company.

As a data analyst, it is our challenge to understand the data, find business opportunities & insights and to propose any data driven action to optimize the campaigns results & generate value to the company.
